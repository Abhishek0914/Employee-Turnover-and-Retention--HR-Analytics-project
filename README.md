# Employee-Turnover-and-Retention--HR-Analytics-project
This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for a study on factors affecting employee turnover and retention. The project examines the relationships between job satisfaction, monthly income, work-life balance, and overtime, providing insights into which factors contribute most significantly to employee retention.

Project Overview
The study focuses on three key hypotheses:

Monthly Income and Job Satisfaction: There is no strong relationship between monthly income and job satisfaction.
Predictors of Job Satisfaction: Monthly income and overtime significantly predict job satisfaction.
Work-Life Balance Across Income Groups: There is no significant difference in work-life balance among employees in different income groups.
Using regression analysis, ANOVA, and chi-square tests, the project evaluates each hypothesis to understand the drivers of job satisfaction and retention within organizations.

Repository Contents
Data: Contains anonymized employee data used in the study.
Analysis: Jupyter notebooks or scripts for statistical tests (e.g., regression, ANOVA).
Results: Detailed statistical outputs and visualizations illustrating relationships between job satisfaction, income, work-life balance, and overtime.
Documentation: Reports and explanations of findings, including conclusions and recommendations for HR and management.
Key Findings
Monthly income alone does not have a strong correlation with job satisfaction.
The combination of monthly income and overtime serves as a significant predictor of job satisfaction.
Work-life balance remains consistent across income groups, emphasizing the need for equitable work-life policies.
